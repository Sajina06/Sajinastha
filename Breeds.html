         <h2>Himalayan Sheepdog</h2>
         <p>A Himalayan Sheepdog who guided us for 7 miles on a trek... It’s almost<br>
         as if he knew that we would get lost after it got dark. He sat with us when<br>
        we rested and ranged ahead and made sure that both of us kept pace with him.</p>
